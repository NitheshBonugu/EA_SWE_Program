# Electronic Arts: Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

In this Virtual Experience Program, you'll experience what life as a Software Engineer at EA would be like. We want you to feel empowered from the beginning with key insights into what lies ahead in your career at EA. Youâ€™ll utilize skills like critical thinking and problem solving while working with languages like Python and C++ to re-create and implement a new game along with so much more. 

## 1. Python

Python is an excellent choice for the initial development of various applications, including games. In this task you need to do the following:

Step 1: Review open-source Python Pac-Man implementations. We've included a couple of them for reference in the Resources below, but you can use any open-source Python implementation. We've also included a primer on PyGame.

Step 2: Pick one of the open-source implementations and download it.

Step 3: Modify it based on the rules of Vax-Man (see above).

NB: if you would like some help during the task, you can use the Python code attached in the Resources section below ('Python Code With Suggestions'). In the Python code with suggestions, we have highlighted the places where you need to make changes. (For reference, the original code can be found here: https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman.)

When making the modification in the code keep in mind that the main difference between Pac-Man and Vax-man is that, in Vax-man, ghosts have the ability to double and ghosts can be killed. As a result, the number of ghosts varies during the game depending on the circumstances, and you need to keep track of arrays of ghosts.

## 2. C++

In this task you need to do the following:
 
Step 1: Review open-source C++ Pac-Man implementations. We've included a couple of them for reference in the Resources below, but you can use any open-source C++ implementation.

Step 2: Pick one of the open-source implementations and download it.

Step 3: Modify it based on the rules of Vax-Man.

NB: if you would like some help during the task, you can use the C++ code files attached in the Resources section below ('C++ Code With Suggestions'). In the C++ code with suggestions, we have highlighted the places where you need to make changes. (For reference, the original code can be found here: https://github.com/dzui42unit/pacman.)

## 3. Game Engine Technology

There are several Game Development Engines that can be used to develop a game: Frostbite, Unreal, Unity, and others. 

Frostbite Engine is the technology behind EA Games and is the core piece of EA's one-team strategy; through the sharing of technology between studios we are creating a shared language for EA developers. Frostbite Engine is not open-source. We have included a video in the Resources section (below) that teaches you more about Frostbite, however this video won't form part of the task.

Given the proprietary nature of Frostbite, you will use an open-source engine for this task. Unreal Engine is a commonly used open-source engine and is a complete suite of development tools for anyone working with real-time technology, from design visualizations and cinematic experiences to high-quality games across PC, console, mobile, VR, and AR.

In the previous tasks you have implemented Vax-Man in Python and C++. In this task, you need to think about how you would use Unreal Engine to implement Vax-Man. Think through how you could implement Vax-Man using Unreal Engine, what steps you will need to take, and what issues you will need to address.

## 4. Mitigating Cyber Vulnerabilities

Video games and video gamers are sometimes targets of cyberattacks. Here are just a few examples of famous cyberattacks: 

"Smash the Stack" - manipulation of the program by causing changes in random memory access, leading to stack buffer overflow.
"Goto Fail Goto Fail" - a copy and paste error that leads to two consecutive Goto Fail statements, which meant that one of them was part of the if statement and the other was always executed.
"Heartbleed Bug" - Heartbleed was a security bug in the OpenSSL library that was traced to a single line of code.
